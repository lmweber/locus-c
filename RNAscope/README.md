RNAscope folder summary:

1. TPH2_TH_SLC6A4_SLC5A7
RNAscope was performed on the three slides that were left from the original 5 donors of the LC project.These slides were made by Sanh/Kristen on 2/6/2020. These three slides were from two donors Br6522(2 slides with 5 section/slide) and Br8079 (1 slide with 3 section). 
Probe panel:
C1: TPH2 (Serotonin marker)
C2: TH (NE marker) [green]
C3: SLC6A4 (Serotonin marker)
C4: SLC5A7 (Choline marker) [pink]
DAPI [blue]
These images were taken on Vectra Polaris at a resolution of 10-20x magnification. 

Folder organization:
Main folder (Donor on that slide)
    -> Section1 (images from the 1st section of the slide)
       - this includes snapshots of individual channels as well as         merged (all channels) and some zoomed-in shots of the              tissue section.

    ->  High power 63x magnification images were taken for one of          the donors Br8079 which show the overlap of TH and SLC5A7          markers within the NE neurons. These images are saved under         the main folder and labeled as '63x_images_of_Br8079'


2. SLC6A2_TH_DBH
We requested 3 additional and performed RNAscope on one of them (Br8689). One slide with two 10um sections was made on 07/28/2022. The RNAscope experiment was performed to validate the overlap of the three NE markers
Probe panel:
C1: SLC6A2 (570) [pink]
C2: TH (520) [green]
C3: DBH (620) [yellow]
DAPI [blue]
